**cliGML** - command-line **Gothic** and **Gothic 2 Gold** Mod Launcher for Linux v.0.03.

**HOW TO USE IT**

Save the script to main Gothic or Gothic 2 directory, make it executable (chmod +x). Read the source, make changes if necessary.

**WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES**

cliGML will search for all .ini files in /system and will display the output (a page at a time if the output list exceeds one page). The user has to manually copy the full name (including extension) of one .ini file, paste it and press RETURN to launch the desired mod.

**WHAT YOU NEED**

For Gothic mods - **Gothic**, **Gothic Player Kit**, at least one installed **mod**, and **WINE**.

For Gothic 2 mods - **Gothic 2 Gold**, **gothic2_fix-2.6.0.0-rev2.exe**, maybe **Gothic II MDK** (ohne Rohdaten), at least one installed **mod**, and **WINE**.

Optional, cliGML will call **7z** for archiving the savegames to main directory. If 7z is not present, it will do nothing.

**PROBLEMS**

If any mod .ini file has the extension .INI, it will not be displayed.

If it will not find the directories /Data or /Data/ModVDF, the script will fail.

**WHAT I NEED**

To add an interactive line selection tool.

**USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

**cliGML** is released under **LICENCE PUBLIQUE RIEN Ã€ BRANLER, Version 1**
